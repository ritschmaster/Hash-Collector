* What is it?
/hash-collector/ is a simple applications which permuts a string with a
specific length and persists all its different hashes.
* What is it for?
/hash-collector/'s purpose is to demonstrate how Common Lisp can be
used in practice. The sense of such an application written in such a
slow language like Common Lisp is excluded. Instead it supplies a non
trival "hello world" example for new coming Lispers. Therefore it is a
part (or extension) of [[https://github.com/ritschmaster/CL-Guide][CL-Guide]].
* Used libraries
- ironclad :: calculates hashes.
- sqlite :: stores the calculated hashes and their plain text in a
            simple SQLite database.
